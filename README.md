# HeavyGraphs
Associative array-backed (hence, "heavy") graphs. Demonstrates the use of
novel design patterns which utilize multiple dispatch, recursion, varargs
functions and functional constructors to provide an interface which
permits the use of Cartesian indexing for access, assignment, adjacency,
growth, pruning, etc. at any depth (w.r.t the node one happens to be on).
